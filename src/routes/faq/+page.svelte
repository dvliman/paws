		<summary> If my pet is matted how will it be handled and what are the charges? </summary>
		<p>
			There are several factors that determine how we handle a matted coat. First, is the matting
			covering the entire body​ or just areas here and there? In cases where the matting is tightly
			covering the entire body this is not a situation where brushing out the coat is possible. The
			only humane way to handle this extensive matting is to shave the dog and start fresh.
			Attempting to brush out matts this severe will cause damage to the skin and be extremely
			painful to the animal.
		</p>
		<p>
			In cases where there are matts in specific areas on the body we can usually dematt this as
			long as the animal tolerates dematting. Just like people, individual animals have different
			levels of pain tolerance and even under the gentlest of groomers hands dematting can be
			painful and sometimes have side effects like skin irritations that may appear several hours
			after grooming when your pet has returned home and the groomer could not see them at the shop.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, if your pet is making it clear that they cannot tolerate the dematting process we will not
			put your pet through undue stress just to achieve a specific "look". We firmly believe in
			humanity over vanity. When dematting cannot be tolerated then shaving is again the only humane
			option for the animal.

	<details>
		<summary> Do you do aggressive dogs? </summary>
		<p>
			Yes, we do handle aggressive dogs. However, our approach depends on the behavior of each
			individual dog. We always strive to work with them and ensure their safety is our top
			priority. Special handling charges may apply, and we kindly ask that you inform us when
			booking so that we can allocate sufficient time and resources for your appointment. Rest
			assured, we make every effort to provide a safe and comfortable experience for all pets in our
			care.
		</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary> Can I stay and watch? </summary>
		<p>
			For the safety of your beloved pet, we kindly ask that you do not stay and watch during the
			grooming process. While we understand your desire to observe, the presence of owners or
			spectators can often excite pets, increasing the risk of injury. Groomers utilize sharp tools
			during styling, and pets that move around on the grooming table are more prone to accidental
			cuts. Please understand that it is not meant to offend you if we request that you or your
			children do not remain in the vicinity of the grooming area. Our top priority is ensuring the
			safety and well-being of your cherished pet.
