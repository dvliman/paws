      impressed w/ the outcome. I'm definitely coming back!!.

      My dog needed grooming after a dirty day at a beach! Most places were
      booked about at least a month. I found this new place from Yelp. I was
      skeptical at first since they're very new in business but since I needed
      the service right away I gave them a try. You'd need to text the number
      provided to make an appointment. The owner responded very quickly and was
      able to book me on the same day. Once confirmed, they'd give you the
      address to drop off your dog. My dog got bath & haircut services and it
      took them about 2 hours to finish. The price is reasonable anOverall I'm
      very happy with the results. Will come back & recommend this place to all
      my dogs lovers!

      The only dog grooming place nearby are always book up months in advance so
      when this new service opens up, I decided to give this place a try. Owners
      are friendly and responsive. They have 3 dogs of their own, so I can tell
      they love their dogs. Who else will be safer to entrust your baby too than
      pawrents themselves. Must say its a refreshing experience to get a new
      cut. Our baby looks so adorable. They have great attention to details.
      Much cleaner cut especially armpits area and behind the legs. Our baby,
      Mochi, will be back for more cut definitely. You should give them a try!
